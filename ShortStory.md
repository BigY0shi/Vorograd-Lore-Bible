# Rise of Kurbanov
### A Vorograd Story

*The transformation of a soldier into a warlord - the origin story of the man who controls Kovrov.*

---

## PROLOGUE: 2014
### Moscow - Ministry of Defense

The office was sparse. Functional. No photographs, no personal effects—just a desk, two chairs, and a window overlooking the gray sprawl of Moscow. Colonel Pavel Kurbanov sat perfectly still, hands folded on the desk, eyes fixed on the man across from him.

"You're being offered a position," the Deputy Minister said. "Regional oversight. Vorograd oblast."

Kurbanov said nothing.

"It's a promotion," the Deputy Minister continued. "Ministry-level authority. Resource allocation. Security coordination."

Still, Kurbanov remained silent.

The Deputy Minister leaned forward. "You understand what this is, Colonel. The region sits on one of the largest mineral deposits in Eastern Europe. Titanium. Lithium. Rare earths. Whoever controls Vorograd controls the future."

Finally, Kurbanov spoke. "And you believe I can control it?"

"I believe you can do what needs to be done."

Kurbanov considered this. Twenty-three years in the GRU. Seventeen missions that didn't officially exist. Three wars where he'd learned that survival wasn't about ideology—it was about power, leverage, and the willingness to use both.

"I accept."

The Deputy Minister smiled. "Good. You start immediately. The Vorograd Industrial Complex will be your primary concern. Old Soviet manufacturing—armaments, chemicals, heavy industry. It's all still operational, barely. Keep it running. Keep it secure. Keep it ours."

Kurbanov stood. "And if someone tries to take it?"

"Then you remind them why you were GRU Spetsnaz for two decades."

---

## PART I: 2014-2022
### The Ministry Years

For eight years, Pavel Kurbanov did exactly what was asked of him. He secured supply lines. He maintained production quotas. He dealt with corruption the way he'd dealt with insurgents in Chechnya—swiftly, quietly, and without mercy.

But he also watched.

He watched as Moscow's authority frayed at the edges. He watched as fuel prices spiked and supply chains fragmented. He watched as the Russo-Ukrainian War ground on, year after year, bleeding both nations white.

And he prepared.

By 2018, Kurbanov had mapped every facility in the Kovrov Industrial Complex. He knew which factories could be converted to weapons production. He knew which warehouses held strategic materials. He knew which rail lines could be defended and which roads could be blocked.

By 2020, he'd identified every power broker in the region—oligarchs, bureaucrats, criminal syndicates. He cataloged their interests, their weaknesses, their leverage points.

By 2022, he no longer reported to Moscow. He simply informed them of his decisions.

No one complained. The minerals kept flowing. The factories kept running. And Kurbanov kept order.

---

## PART II: 2031-2032
### The Disintegration

When the collapse came, it didn't come all at once. It came in stages—each one more catastrophic than the last.

First, the payroll stopped. Military units in Vorograd went three months without pay. Then six. Officers began selling equipment to feed their families. Soldiers deserted in entire platoons.

Then the supply chains failed. Fuel shipments stopped arriving. Food became scarce. Electricity became intermittent.

Then Moscow stopped answering.

Kurbanov watched from his office in Vorograd city as the federal government simply... stopped functioning. Orders went unanswered. Requests for support were ignored. The lines of authority that had held Russia together for a century dissolved like smoke.

And then came the nuclear exchanges.

Not a world-ending apocalypse. Just limited strikes—Sevastopol, a handful of military bases, infrastructure targets. Tactical warheads designed to cripple, not annihilate.

But it was enough.

The internet collapsed. Global trade ceased. Regional warlords emerged across the former Russian territories, each claiming legitimacy, each fighting for survival.

In Vorograd, Kurbanov made his choice.

He gathered his most loyal officers—former GRU, former Spetsnaz, men who understood that loyalty was a currency more valuable than rubles.

"Moscow is gone," he told them. "Not destroyed. Just... irrelevant. We're on our own now."

"What are you proposing?" one asked.

Kurbanov gestured to a map of the region. "We hold Kovrov. We hold the mines. We hold the factories. And we build something that survives."

"A government?"

"Order," Kurbanov corrected. "Government implies bureaucracy. I'm talking about control. Discipline. Survival."

Another officer spoke. "The local population won't accept military rule."

"They'll accept food," Kurbanov said flatly. "They'll accept security. They'll accept someone who can keep the lights on and the wolves at bay. Everything else is negotiable."

And so the Federal Security Directorate was born—not as a government, but as an organization. Kurbanov's organization.

---

## PART III: 2033-2035
### Order from Chaos

The first year was the hardest.

Rival warlords tried to take Kovrov. Kurbanov's FSD forces repelled them—not through superior numbers, but through superior discipline and knowledge of the terrain.

Local insurgents formed. They called themselves the Grey Wolves and fought for "freedom" and "the people." Kurbanov let them have the residential districts. He didn't need them. He needed the factories, the mines, the roads. Everything else was secondary.

But the nuclear program—that was different.

Kurbanov had discovered it by accident. An old Soviet research facility buried beneath the Kovrov Administrative Center. Decommissioned in the 1990s. Forgotten.

But not dismantled.

The uranium was still there. The equipment, outdated but functional. And Kurbanov had engineers—brilliant, desperate engineers who would work for food and protection.

"Can it be done?" he asked his chief scientist.

"A functional nuclear device? Yes. It won't be sophisticated. But it will work."

"How long?"

"Five years. Maybe less if we prioritize."

Kurbanov nodded. "Do it. Quietly."

Because he understood something the Grey Wolves and the other warlords didn't: in a world without central authority, the only thing that mattered was leverage. And nothing provided leverage like nuclear weapons.

By 2035, the Federal Security Directorate controlled Kovrov completely. The Grey Wolves harassed them, sabotaged them, killed FSD soldiers whenever they could—but they couldn't dislodge Kurbanov.

And the nuclear program was 70% complete.

---

## EPILOGUE: 2043
### The Warlord

Eight years after the collapse, Pavel Kurbanov stood in the same office where he'd accepted the Ministry position in 2014. But Moscow was a thousand kilometers away and might as well have been on another planet.

He was 61 years old. His hair was gray, his face lined. But his eyes were the same—cold, calculating, utterly certain.

On his desk sat a single file: intelligence reports on foreign operators active in Kovrov. Mercenaries. Extraction specialists. Sent by interests he couldn't quite identify—private intelligence firms, maybe, or corporate entities looking to seize strategic materials.

It didn't matter. They were witnesses to something they couldn't be allowed to report.

He picked up the radio. "Taskmaster, this is Kurbanov."

"Go ahead."

"The operators in Sector Seven. I want them contained. No extractions. No escapes. Make it look like a Grey Wolf operation if they're eliminated."

"Understood."

Kurbanov set down the radio and returned to the window. Vorograd spread before him—broken, bleeding, but functional. He'd built order from chaos. He'd created stability through force.

And he would defend it with everything he had.

Because in the end, that's what survival required: ruthlessness, discipline, and the willingness to do what others wouldn't.

Pavel Kurbanov had become exactly what the world needed him to be.

A warlord.

A strongman.

A man who understood that in the ruins of civilization, only power mattered.
